description: Use when the user asks to run, execute, implement, or carry out a Strikethroo plan or its blueprint by plan ID in this repository — triggers include execute blueprint, run the plan, implement plan, build the plan. Do not use to create a plan, to only generate tasks, to run a single task, or for generic development outside Strikethroo.

# st-execute-blueprint

Drive the end-to-end execution of an existing Strikethroo plan blueprint. The skill is assistant-agnostic and self-contained: every script it invokes lives under this skill's `scripts/` directory and is referenced by relative path.

## Critical Rules

1. **Never skip validation gates** — a phase is not complete until `POST_PHASE.md` succeeds.
2. **Preserve dependency order** — never execute a task before all of its dependencies are completed.
3. **Maximize parallelism within each phase** — run all tasks whose dependencies are satisfied simultaneously.
4. **Fail safely and document everything** — halt on unrecoverable errors, and record all decisions, issues, and outcomes under "Noteworthy Events" in the execution summary.

## Inputs

The user supplies the numeric plan ID conversationally. Treat it as the only authoritative source of intent. Do not invent answers to clarifying questions — prompt the user instead.

## Operating Procedure

### 1. Locate the strikethroo root

Run `scripts/find-strikethroo-root.cjs` from the user's working directory.
The script walks up looking for `.ai/strikethroo/.init-metadata.json` and
prints the absolute path of the resolved root on success.

If the script exits non-zero, the working directory is not inside an
initialized strikethroo workspace. Stop and ask the user to run the project
initializer (e.g. `npx strikethroo init`) before continuing. Do
not attempt to execute a plan outside of a valid root.

For every subsequent step, treat the path printed by this script as `<root>`.

### 2. Resolve the plan

Run `scripts/validate-plan-blueprint.cjs <plan-id> planFile` to obtain the
absolute path of the plan file. The same script also accepts these field
names (single-field output mode) and exposes them on demand:

- `planDir` — absolute path of the plan directory
- `taskCount` — number of existing task files in that plan's `tasks/`
- `blueprintExists` — `yes` or `no`
- `taskManagerRoot` — absolute path of `<root>`
- `planId` — the resolved numeric plan ID

If the script exits non-zero, stop and ask the user to confirm the plan ID.
Do not guess a different ID.

### 3. Validate tasks and blueprint existence

Inspect the `taskCount` and `blueprintExists` values returned by the validation script.

### 4. Auto-generate tasks and blueprint if missing

If `taskCount` is 0 or `blueprintExists` is `no`:

- Notify the user: "Tasks or execution blueprint not found. Generating tasks automatically..."
- Follow the `st-generate-tasks` skill for this plan ID. Execute its operating procedure in full, including running `POST_TASK_GENERATION_ALL.md` to write the Execution Blueprint.
- After generation completes, re-run `scripts/validate-plan-blueprint.cjs <plan-id> planFile` (and the other fields) to refresh the resolved paths and counts.

If generation still leaves the plan without tasks or a blueprint, stop and report failure. Do not attempt execution without a valid blueprint.

### 5. Optionally create a feature branch

Run `scripts/create-feature-branch.cjs <plan-id>` once before phase execution. Branch creation is best-effort: when the script reports that it skipped creation (for example, not on `main`/`master`), continue on the current branch and do not retry or create a branch manually. Uncommitted or untracked changes are permitted only when every change is inside the repository-root `.ai/strikethroo` subtree, so a newly generated plan and tasks can remain uncommitted before execution. When the script exits with an error—including changes anywhere outside that subtree or an inability to inspect Git status on `main`/`master`—halt and report the error. Do not treat a skipped branch as a failure or spend effort working around a skip.

### 6. Load project context and execution blueprint

Read these files, in order:

- `<root>/config/STRIKETHROO.md` — directory conventions and project context.
- The plan document at the path returned by step 2.
- The plan's Execution Blueprint section — this defines the phase groupings and task dispatch order.
- `<root>/config/shared/verification-gate.md` and `<root>/config/shared/anti-rationalization.md` — apply in the phase loop below.

### 7. Execute phases in order

Use an internal task or todo tracker to monitor progress. For each phase defined in the Execution Blueprint:

#### 7a. Phase pre-execution
Run `scripts/check-phase-readiness.cjs <plan-id> <phase-number>`. If the script exits non-zero, halt the phase and report the blocking issues before continuing.

Read `<root>/config/hooks/PRE_PHASE.md` and execute its instructions before starting the phase.

#### 7b. Task dispatch
Identify all tasks scheduled for this phase whose dependencies are fully satisfied. Read `<root>/config/hooks/PRE_TASK_ASSIGNMENT.md` and follow its instructions for agent selection before dispatching tasks.

Resolve every selected task's execution route first. Invoke one resolver per selected
task simultaneously in a single parallel tool operation:

```text
scripts/dispatch-task-execution.cjs resolve <task-file> <current-harness> <workspace> <plan-id> <task-id>
```

Resolvers never launch external processes. After interpreting all route results, issue
all `external-override` executions and all native Task-tool agents **together in one
parallel tool operation**. External execution uses:

```text
scripts/dispatch-task-execution.cjs execute <handoff> <task-file> <current-harness> <workspace> <plan-id> <task-id>
```

`<handoff>` is the exact opaque `handoff` string returned by that task's
`external-override` resolver result. Never reconstruct it, reuse it for another
task, or rerun resolution after launches begin. Execute validates the handoff
and does not reread routing configuration, so configuration changes cannot
alter an already selected target.

This two-step protocol is mandatory: do not execute external tasks during route
resolution, do not serialize external commands, and do not wait for external completion
before launching ready native agents. If an execute-time pre-flight returns `fallback`,
record its reason and immediately launch the ordinary native path without override prose.

`<current-harness>` is the exact supported harness identifier running this
skill and `<workspace>` is the project working directory. Interpret its JSON
result before choosing a route: `native-default` uses ordinary native dispatch;
`native-override` uses native dispatch with explicit exact-model prose and
reasoning-effort prose only when returned; `fallback` visibly records its
reason then uses ordinary native dispatch with no override prose;
`launched-success` has already completed externally and receives normal status
and evidence review; `launched-failure` is a failed task and must enter the
existing error-hook/status path without any native retry; `infrastructure-failure`
is also a failed task, must be marked failed, and must run
`<root>/config/hooks/POST_ERROR_DETECTION.md` without native retry. The command
always emits exactly one JSON line; exit code `2` identifies entrypoint/infrastructure
failure while exit code `1` identifies a launched task failure.

Deploy all remaining native agents simultaneously using your internal Task tool. Each agent MUST:

1. Read and execute `<root>/config/hooks/PRE_TASK_EXECUTION.md` before starting any implementation work.
2. Execute the task according to its requirements.
3. Monitor execution progress and capture outputs and artifacts.
4. Update task status in real-time.

Maximize parallelism within each phase. Run every task that is ready at the same time.

#### 7c. Phase completion verification
Ensure every task in the phase has status `completed`. Collect and review all task outputs. Document any issues or exceptions encountered.

Do not accept a subagent's report of success as proof. Apply the evidence gate in `<root>/config/shared/verification-gate.md` before marking the phase complete. Do not mark a phase complete on an unverified claim.

#### 7d. Phase post-execution
Read `<root>/config/hooks/POST_PHASE.md` and execute its instructions. Do not proceed to the next phase until this hook succeeds.

Update the phase status to `completed` in the plan's Execution Blueprint section.

Repeat for the next phase until all phases are complete.

Apply `<root>/config/shared/anti-rationalization.md` to this rationalization table:

| You catch yourself thinking… | The binding rule |
| --- | --- |
| "The subagent reported success, so the task is done." | A report is a claim, not evidence. Apply the verification gate before marking the phase complete. |
| "The tests probably pass." | "Probably" is a red flag. Run the proving command, read its output and exit code, then state the result. |
| "I'll verify later, after the next phase." | A phase is not complete until `POST_PHASE.md` succeeds against verified evidence. Verify now; do not advance on an unverified phase. |

### 8. Post-execution validation

Read `<root>/config/hooks/POST_EXECUTION.md` and execute its instructions. If validation fails, halt execution. The plan remains in `plans/` for debugging.

Before declaring execution complete, apply the evidence gate in `<root>/config/shared/verification-gate.md` to the plan's Success Criteria and Self Validation steps.

### 9. Append execution summary

Append an execution summary section to the plan document using the format described in `<root>/config/templates/EXECUTION_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md`. Populate:

- **Status**: Completed Successfully
- **Completed Date**: current date
- **Results**: brief summary of deliverables
- **Noteworthy Events**: all decisions, issues, and outcomes encountered during execution. If none occurred, state "No significant issues encountered."
- **Necessary follow-ups**: any follow-up actions or optimizations

### 10. Archive the plan

Move the completed plan directory from `<root>/plans/<plan-folder>` to `<root>/archive/<plan-folder>`.

Preserve the entire folder structure (including all tasks and subdirectories) to maintain referential integrity. If the move fails, log the error but do not fail the overall execution — the implementation work is complete.

## Failure Modes

- **No strikethroo root found.** Stop and instruct the user to initialize the project. Do not execute any tasks.
- **Plan ID does not resolve.** Stop and surface the script's stderr to the user. Do not guess a different ID.
- **Missing blueprint after auto-generation.** If the `st-generate-tasks` skill fails to produce tasks or a blueprint, stop and report failure. Do not attempt execution without a blueprint.
- **Hook failure.** If `PRE_PHASE.md`, `POST_PHASE.md`, or `POST_EXECUTION.md` fails, halt execution. The plan remains in `plans/` for debugging and potential re-execution.
- **Execution errors.** If a task fails, read `<root>/config/hooks/POST_ERROR_DETECTION.md`, document the error in Noteworthy Events, halt the phase, and request user direction before continuing.

## Execution Summary

Conclude with exactly this block as the final output:

```
---
Execution Summary:
- Plan ID: [numeric-id]
- Status: Archived
- Location: [absolute path to archive directory]
---
```

The summary is consumed by downstream automation; keep the format exact.
